This is a little library made for editing single bits from the _lower_8_
_bits_ of an integer. The functions & subs of the BitEdit lib are:

 BitStr$(Num%) - Returns Num% as a string of 8 1's and 0's.
 
 BitVal%(wBit$) - Returns the value of the byte in wBit$. wBit$ must be
   a string of 8 1's and 0's.

 BitShift Num%, WhichWay%, HowMany% - Shifts the bits in Num% by HowMany%
   spaces. WhichWay% can be either 0 for a left shift or anyting else for a
   right shift. HowMany% can also be seen as how many zeros are added to
   whatever side of the byte (that my be easier to visualize).

 BitSet Num%, wBit%, bSet% - Sets the bit at space wBit% in Num% to bSet%.
   Please note that this sub is a bit slower then the others. If you are
   using it in a program going for speed I would reccomend directly editing
   the bits in a string (although if you are only setting one bit in one
   number then BitSet would be faster).

 BitGet%(Num%, wBit%) - Returns the value of the bit at space wBit% in Num%.

PLEASE NOTE:
 -> This program reads bytes from right to left.
 -> The first bit space is always 1 (not 0), and the last 8.
 -> This program only uses the _lower_ 8 bits of a byte, and integers that
    are greater than 255 are ANDed with 255 (you can also use a single
    character to store the values, but remember to convert the values back).
 -> Remember to $INCLUDE the BIT_EDIT.BI file into yor program so that the
    subs and functions are defined correctly.
