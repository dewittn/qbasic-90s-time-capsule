        I. Terms used in this manual
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Here are a few general terms used in this manual (explained later).

SUD            -       Single User Dimension
DB             -       DataBase
DB Nr / DB#    -       DataBase Number
Reg            -       Reister
Parse          -       Process a command
Parser         -       Part of the program that processes commands
Pre-Parse(r)   -  Part of the program that processes functions
Thing          -       Object, Room, or Exit
Universal      -     Avialable to the whole SUD


        II. What is a SUD?
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You are probably asking: "What is a SUD?". Well, A Single User
Dimension is based on Things. A Thing is either a Object, Room,
or Exit. Each functions in a different way. You can pick up or drop
and object, you can connect rooms and walk throgh exits, and you
can walk into or put objects in rooms. Using these three types of
Things, you can build up whole worlds. Well, you ask, what is so
special about setting up endless sieries of rooms? Wouldn't that
get a bit boring? The answer would be no, because SUDs have
one special thing: you can code objects so they can execute special
commands and even make these commands universal. This gives a neat
touch to the game. You can code TVs, spaceships, and even whole
worlds.

        III. What is the DB and how does it work?
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The DataBase is the main part of a SUD or any other SUD-like game.
It stores all information about the Things in the SUD. Each thing has
its own number, called the DB Number, which never changes (unless
the Thing is destoryed). You can imagine the DB Nr like a filename.
There are special sections in each "file" that store the data that
is needed for that object. When a object is destroyed all the data
in a "file" is deleted and the filename (DB Nr) is marked "FREE".
The general input (the way you should type it) syntax of a DB is
"#(DB Nr)", and the general output (the way it is displayed) syntax
is "# (DB Nr)". The best way to find an object is by using its DB Nr
because it is unique.

        IV. Navigating in a SUD
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
General SUD commands:

LOOK or L (Look around)
        The easiest command. Makes you look around the room you are
        currently in. (SEE: L [THING])

I (Inventory)
        With this command you can see what you are carrying. The maximum
        number of objects you can carry is limited to the amount of memory
        availiable. (SEE: TAKE, DROP)

TAKE [OBJECT] (Pick up)
        With TAKE you can pick up an object if it is in your location.
        The object is placed in your inventory. (SEE: I)

DROP [OBJECT] (Put down)
        Just the opposite of TAKE, you take an object out of your
        inventory and put it in your location. (SEE: I)

L [THING] (Look at an object)
        Look at the Thing [THING]. [THING] can be an Object, Exit, "here"
        (for the room you are in), or a DB Nr.

GO [EXIT ALIAS] (Walk through an Exit)
        Causes you to walk through an Exit in your location. [EXIT ALIAS]
        means the letters in the <>'s after the Exit. Instead of typing
        "GO [EXIT ALIAS]" every time, you can just type the [EXIT ALIAS].


        V. Advanced SUD Commands
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Advanced SUD Commands:
EX [THING] (Examine)
        Shows you all the data on the Thing [THING]. For a Room that would
        be description, contents, and exits. For a Exit that would be from,
        to, lock, and description. For a Object description, location, V-Regs,
        and lock. [THING] can be a name of a thing, "here", or a DB Nr.
@find [THING] (List [THING]s or find [THING]s)
        This command has two ways to be used: with a name or with a DB Nr.
        If you use a name for [THING], @find will list all the things in
        the DB with the name (or alias for Exits) [THING]. If you use a
        DB Nr for [THING], @find will locate the object (or exit, no rooms)
        for you. NOTE: @find may return nothing, meaning that it did
        not find the thing.
@listall (List DB)
        A simple command which shows you the Things in the DB. This is useful
        if you want to check if there are any "stray" objects in the DB.
@tel [ROOM DB NR] (Teleport into a room)
        @tel is short for teleport. The command is very simple. Used if you
        want to "jump" to a room.

Thing Commands:
@name [OLD NAME]=[NEW NAME] (Change something's name)
